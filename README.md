Hello everyone. 

I ask you not to be too hard, as these are my first attempts to do something with solo training and trying everything. 

I am open to criticism and help, correct hints, etc. 
The clicker has just started to be made literally today and it will naturally be updated, supplemented, and so on.  

Thanks for your attention!
